  <p>Bread of Life began in 1992 by serving 500 hot meals a day to homeless individuals in midtown Houston. With the help of<br>
a close partnership with Beyonce and Tina Knowles-Lawson, they have coordinated numerous anti-hunger initiatives and<br>
 provided emergency support during natural disasters, in addition to their outreach to the homeless.</p>
