                                    Cardiovascular exercise, such as stair-climbing, speed-walking, walking,
                                    swimming, and running, is one technique to improve body appearance. Increasing
                                    body strength does as much to changing the body's appearance and aid in losing
                                    weight as diet and cardiovascular activity.</p>

                                    oxygen-rich blood to the working muscles of your body and, in turn, the ability
                                    of those muscles to use oxygen to produce energy for movement.</p>
